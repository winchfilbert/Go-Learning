in here, we're gonna handle request and response using JSON also know about logging



#Logging
as simple as it gets, the logging is just actually like, you wanna check or track your code's compilation progress ( i mean sometimes we get our code stuck/error at some line, and we just want to validate if it's working properly)

it uses the log keyword

log does give timestamp, it gives detail explanation than regular debug 
(like putting fmt.printf, to check this/check that)
